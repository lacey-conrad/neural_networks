As a novice data scientist, I am finding myself drawn towards machine learning and deep learning in particular.  This repo is for code and information I have collected to help teach myself more about CNN and DNN.  The end goal of this repo is to have multiple working object detection models in both PyTorch and Tensorflow with an particular focus in the production of model evaluation metrics.
